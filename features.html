<center><p>In 1831 Major Jonathan Forbes of the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot of the British Army, while returning on horseback<br>
           from a trip to Pollonnuruwa, encountered the "bush covered summit of Sigiriya".Sigiriya came to the attention of antiquarians<br>
           and, later, archaeologists. Archaeological work at Sigiriya began on a small scale in the 1890s. H.C.P. Bell was the first archaeologist<br>
           to conduct extensive research on Sigiriya. The Cultural Triangle Project, launched by the Government of Sri Lanka, focused its attention<br>
           on Sigiriya in 1982. Archaeological work began on the entire city for the first time under this project. There was a sculpted lion's head<br>
           above the legs and paws flanking the entrance, but the head collapsed years ago.</p></center>

<center><p>Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century. The Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper<br>
           palace located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes,<br>
           the lower palaces clings to the slopes below the rocks. The moats, walls and gardens of the palace extended for a few hundred metres<br>
           from the base of the rock. The site was both a palace and a fortress. The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock.</p><center>
