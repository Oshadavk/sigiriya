<center><p>The Cūḷavaṃsa and folklore inform us that the battle-elephant on which Kashyapa was mounted changed course to take a strategic advantage,<br>
           but the army misinterpreted the movement as the king's having opted to retreat, prompting the army to abandon him altogether. It is said<br>
           that being too proud to surrender he took his dagger from his waistband, cut his throat, raised the dagger proudly, sheathed it, and fell dead.<br>
           Moggallana returned the capital to Anuradhapura, converting Sigiriya into a Buddhist monastery complex,which survived until the 13th or 14th century.<br>
           After this period, no records are found on Sigiriya until the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was used briefly as an outpost of the Kingdom of Kandy.</p></center>

<center><p>Alternative stories have the primary builder of Sigiriya as King Dhatusena, with Kashyapa finishing the work in honour of his father. Still other stories describe<br>
           Kashyapa as a playboy king, with Sigiriya his pleasure palace. Even Kashyapa's eventual fate is uncertain. In some versions he is assassinated by poison administered<br>
           by a concubine; in others he cuts his own throat when deserted in his final battle.[6] Still further interpretations regard the site as the work of a Buddhist community,<br>
           without a military function. This site may have been important in the competition between the Mahayana and Theravada Buddhist traditions in ancient Sri Lanka.</p></center>

<center><p>In Professor Senarath Paranavithana's book The Story of Sigiriya, King Dathusena is said to have taken the advice of the Persian Nestorian Priest Maga Brahmana on building<br>
           his palace on Sigirya. According to Paranavithana, during this period over seventy-five ships carrying Murundi soldiers from Mangalore arrived in Sri Lanka and landed<br>
           in Chilaw to protect King Dathusena, most of them Christians. King Dathusena's daughter was married to Migara, a Christian and the commander of the Singhalese army.</p></center>
