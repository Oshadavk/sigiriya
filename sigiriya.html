<center><p>Sigiriya or Sinhagiri is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka.<br>
                           It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of rock approximately 180 m (590 ft) high.</p></center>

<center><p>According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cūḷavaṃsa, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides it became a hill and was <br>
                   selected by King Kashyapa (AD 477–495) for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes.<br>
                   On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from<br>
                   this structure; Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock.</p></center>
<center><p>The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.Sigiriya today is<br>
                   a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning.</p></center>
