<br>
<center><p>It is likely that the area around Sigiriya may have been inhabited since prehistoric times. There is clear evidence that<br>
           the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BC.<br>
           The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that<br>
           the area was occupied nearly five thousand years ago during the Mesolithic Period.</p></center>

<center><p>Buddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills<br>
           surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders,<br>
           with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the<br>
           donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century AD.</p></center>

<center><p>In 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king’s son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara,<br>
           the King’s nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana,<br>
           Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa’s <br>
           reign (477 to 495 AD), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress.Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it,<br>
           including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period.</p></center>

<center><p>The Cūḷavaṃsa describes King Kashyapa as the son of King Dhatusena. Kashyapa murdered his father by walling him up alive and then usurping the throne<br>
           which rightfully belonged to his half-brother Moggallana, Dhatusena's son by the true queen. Moggallana fled to India to escape being assassinated<br>
           by Kashyapa, but vowed revenge. In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka, which he considered to be<br>
           rightfully his. Expecting the inevitable return of Moggallana, Kashyapa is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress as well as a pleasure palace.<br>
           Moggallana finally arrived, declared war, and defeated Kashyapa in 495 CE. During the battle Kashyapa's armies abandoned him and he committed suicide by falling on his sword.</p></center>
