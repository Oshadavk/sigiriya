<center><p>Sigiriya is considered to be one of the most important urban planning sites of the first millennium,<br>
           and the site plan is considered very elaborate and imaginative. The plan combined concepts of symmetry and asymmetry<br>
           to intentionally interlock the man-made geometrical and natural forms of the surroundings. On the west side of the rock<br>
           lies a park for the royals, laid out on a symmetrical plan; the park contains water-retaining structures, including sophisticated<br>
           surface/subsurface hydraulic systems, some of which are working today. The south contains a man-made reservoir; these were extensively<br>
           used from the previous capital of the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Five gates were placed at entrances. The more elaborate western gate is thought<br>
           to have been reserved for the royals.</p></center>
